    <div id = "Mid">
        <i><h2>Mid Quad</h2></i>
        <p>I live in this quad, which has a central location adjacent to <span id = "parents">Parents Field</span>. There are a mix of singles, doubles, and even triples. There is working air conditioning as well, which is a huge benefit</p>

    <div id = "North">
        <i><h2>North Quad</h2></i>
        <p>This is the most social quad, located on the boulevard that connects the cube to <span id = "bauer">Bauer Center</span>. There is great social life here, but no air conditioning</p>

        <div id = "South">
            <i><h2>South Quad</h2></i>
            <p>This is the quietest quad, with many singles. Athletes and introverts live here for the most part</p>
